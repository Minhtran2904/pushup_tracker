# pushup_tracker
My personal project that aims to improve my fundamental knowledge in Python programming, and to track my physical activities. Expansion is to be expected.

Update 15.05.2023:
First function defined: update_statistics() 

The program will prompt the amount of push-up done for today and keep adding so long as I keep adding numbers.
Stores in variable days_count

input "trend" regardless of casing will prompt statistics of:
- Streak
- Average push-up per day
- Average increase/-decrease in accumulation (needs at least 2 days to make statistic)

Coming up:
- Add extra function
- Draw statistic chart or form of visualisation 
- Learn to make user interface
